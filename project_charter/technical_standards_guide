## 1. Document Purpose

This document is the official style guide and technical rulebook for the AI Solutions Architect. It contains explicit, low-level standards for generating project artifacts to ensure consistency, maintainability, and correct rendering on target platforms like GitHub. The AI's constitution requires strict adherence to all rules defined herein.

## 2. Artifact Generation Standards

### 2.1. Markdown File Generation (`.md`)
- **Standard S-1 (Raw Markdown Mandate):** All artifacts intended for `.md` files on GitHub must be provided as raw, clean Markdown text. The AI is strictly forbidden from wrapping its entire response in an outer ` ```markdown ` code block.

### 2.2. Mermaid Diagram Rendering
- **Standard S-2 (HTML Encapsulation):** To ensure flawless rendering of diagrams on GitHub, any ` ```mermaid ` block must be correctly nested *inside* `<details>` and `<summary>` HTML tags. The closing `</details>` tag must come *after* the closing ` ``` ` of the Mermaid block.
- **Example:**
    ```html
    <details>
    <summary>Click to expand Diagram</summary>

    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        A --> B
    ```

    </details>
    ```

### 2.3. Nested Code Block Rendering (e.g., JSON in Markdown)
- **Standard S-3 (Indentation Escape):** If a standard code block (like JSON) needs to be displayed *inside another Markdown code block*, the inner block must be properly escaped by indenting every line with four spaces.
- **Note:** This standard is rarely used now, as Standard S-1 (Raw Markdown) is the preferred method. It is maintained here for edge cases.

## 3. Changelog
- **v1.0 (Current):** Document created to separate low-level technical standards from the high-level principles in the AI's Operating Manual. This is intended to finally resolve recurring Markdown formatting and rendering issues.
